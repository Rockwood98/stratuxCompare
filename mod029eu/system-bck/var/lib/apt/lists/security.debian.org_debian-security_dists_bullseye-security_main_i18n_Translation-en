Description-en: Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment - static binary
 AIDE is an intrusion detection system that detects changes to files on
 the local system. It creates a database from the regular expression rules
 that it finds from the config file. Once this database is initialized
 it can be used to verify the integrity of the files. It has several
 message digest algorithms (md5, sha1, rmd160, tiger, haval, etc.) that are
 used to check the integrity of the file. More algorithms can be added
 with relative ease. All of the usual file attributes can also be checked
 for inconsistencies.
 .
 This package contains the statically linked binary for "normal"
 systems.

Package: liblog4j2-java
Description-md5: 45f804957a9794c4f807c12a4e0985f7
Description-en: Apache Log4j - Logging Framework for Java
 Apache Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements
 over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x:
 .
 API Separation: The API for Log4j is separate from the implementation making
 it clear for application developers which classes and methods they can use
 while ensuring forward compatibility.
 .
 Improved Performance: Log4j 2 contains next-generation Asynchronous Loggers
 based on the LMAX Disruptor library. In multi-threaded scenarios Asynchronous
 Loggers have 10 times higher throughput and orders of magnitude lower latency
 than Log4j 1.x.
 .
 Support for multiple APIs: While the Log4j 2 API will provide the best
 performance, Log4j 2 provides support for the SLF4J and Commons Logging APIs.
 .
 Automatic Reloading of Configurations: Log4j 2 can automatically reload its
 configuration upon modification. It will do so without losing log events
 while reconfiguration is taking place.
 .
 Advanced Filtering: Log4j 2 supports filtering based on context
 data, markers, regular expressions, and other components in the Log event.
 Filtering can be specified to apply to all events before being passed to
 Loggers or as they pass through Appenders.
 .
 Plugin Architecture: Log4j uses the plugin pattern to configure components.
 As such, no code is needed to create and configure an Appender, Layout,
 Pattern Converter, and so on. Log4j automatically recognizes plugins
 and uses them when a configuration references them.
 .
 Property Support: Properties can be referenced in a configuration, Log4j will
 directly replace them, or Log4j will pass them to an underlying component that
 will dynamically resolve them. Properties come from values defined in the
 configuration file, system properties, environment variables, the
 ThreadContext Map, and data present in the event.

 email). Simplicity does not mean less features; Epiphany has everything
 a modern web browser is expected to have.
 .
 Standards compliance is achieved on the HTML side by using the
 WebKitGTK+ rendering engine (which is based on the engine used by
 Apple Safari and Google Chrome); and on the user interface side by
 closely following the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) and by
 close integration with the GNOME desktop.

 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").

Package: flatpak
Description-md5: f91acb1d2880527b2759bc5e2d99fbff
Description-en: Application deployment framework for desktop apps
 Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
 Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
 containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
 to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
 via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
 example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
 sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.
 .
 Each application uses a specified "runtime", or set of libraries, which is
 available as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application
 bundles with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within
 the same desktop environment.
 .
 This package contains the services and executables needed to install and
 launch sandboxed applications, and the portal services needed to provide
 limited access to resources outside the sandbox.

Description-en: Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again
 The features of the XStream library are:
 .
  - Ease of use. A high level facade is supplied that simplifies common
    use cases.
  - No mappings required. Most objects can be serialized without need
    for specifying mappings.
  - Performance. Speed and low memory footprint are a crucial part of
    the design, making it suitable for large object graphs or systems
    with high message throughput.
  - Clean XML. No information is duplicated that can be obtained via
    reflection. This results in XML that is easier to read for humans
    and more compact than native Java serialization.
  - Requires no modifications to objects. Serializes internal fields,
    including private and final. Supports non-public and inner classes.
    Classes are not required to have default constructor.
  - Full object graph support. Duplicate references encountered in the
    object-model will be maintained. Supports circular references.
  - Integrates with other XML APIs. By implementing an interface,
    XStream can serialize directly to/from any tree structure (not just
    XML).
  - Customizable conversion strategies. Strategies can be registered
    allowing customization of how particular types are represented as
    XML.
  - Error messages. When an exception occurs due to malformed XML,
    detailed diagnostics are provided to help isolate and fix the
    problem.
  - Alternative output format. The modular design allows other output
    formats. XStream ships currently with JSON support and morphing.

 As the Debian packages switched to Python 3, it isn't possible to run using
 Eventlet (ie: the standalone neutron-server daemon) if we use SSL, because of
 defects in python3-eventlet. So the Debian package maitainer decided to switch
 to uwsgi instead. In this mode, one needs to also run neutron-rpc-server to
 listen for requests on the message bus (ie: rabbitmq in most cases). For this
 reason, the neutron-server package has been split into neutron-api and
 neutron-rpc-server.

 also be easily gathered.  Quick introspection into running
 systems becomes a reality.
 .
 Remote execution is usually used to set up a certain state on a
 remote system. Salt addresses this problem as well, the salt
 state system uses salt state files to define the state a server
 needs to be in.
 .
 Between the remote execution system, and state management Salt
 addresses the backbone of cloud and data center management.
 .
 This particular package provides the master of masters for salt
 - it enables the management of multiple masters at a time.

Package: ctdb
Description-md5: 83dff66615250b53a0cd3df6fb3b9ea7
Description-en: clustered database to store temporary data
 CTDB is a cluster implementation of the TDB database used by Samba and other
 projects to store temporary data. If an application is already using TDB for
 temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware
 and use CTDB instead.
 .
 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,
 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Package: tor-geoipdb
Description-md5: d0b50c9cd91157b8c85856fd55e26d14
Description-en: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

Package: xdmx
Description-md5: 9e6fe3aa398121b6dd37b516ff31f0fc
Description-en: distributed multihead X server
 Xdmx is a proxy X server that uses one or more other X servers as its
 display device(s). It provides multi-head X functionality for displays that
 might be located on different machines. Xdmx functions as a front-end X server
 that acts as a proxy to a set of back-end X servers. All of the visible
 rendering is passed to the back-end X servers. Clients connect to the Xdmx
 front-end, and everything appears as it would in a regular multi-head
 configuration. If Xinerama is enabled (e.g., with +xinerama on the command
 line), the clients see a single large screen.

Package: xvfb
Description-md5: 1cd5b85acd06c23d376b7b5a7f30a0b8
Description-en: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.

Package: xz-utils
Description-md5: ea97a558c8575aebbed2c11cbd20e0f2
Description-en: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

Package: xzdec
Description-md5: 30227ffce3f42144b3b624776f996bbf
Description-en: XZ-format compression utilities - tiny decompressors
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the xzdec and lzmadec utilities, which write
 the decompressed version of a compressed file to standard output. The
 binaries are very small, so they can be easily stored on small media
 with some compressed files, and they are linked statically against
 liblzma so they can be used on machines without a compatible version
 of liblzma installed. However, they have:
 .
   * no compression support;
   * no support for writing to a file other than standard output;
   * no translated messages;
   * been optimized for size rather than speed.
 .
 For a full-featured xzcat command without these limitations, use
 the xz-utils package instead.
